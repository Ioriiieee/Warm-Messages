script.js — verified and forced the DOM update

Added debug logs:
console.log('DEBUG: heart element ->', heart);
console.log('DEBUG: message element ->', msg);
console.log('DEBUG: clicked heart, index=', random, 'message=', chosen);
These confirmed the click handler ran and which message was chosen.
Safeguard for #message existence: checked if (msg) { ... } else { console.warn(...) }.
Added a small inline-style fallback for debugging:
msg.style.transition = 'opacity 0.6s ease' (if not set) and msg.style.opacity = '1' immediately after adding .show.
After 2s we remove the class and set msg.style.opacity = '0'.
Rationale: if some CSS rule was still preventing the .show opacity change, setting inline opacity forces the element visible while we debug.
Why that fixed it

The message element was correctly updated by JS but remained visually hidden because of CSS issues (missing color, duplicated/overridden rules, or stacking order). The combination of explicit color, removing duplicates, setting z-index, and the inline opacity fallback ensured the DOM text change became visible.
What I can do next (recommended)

Remove the debug console.log lines and the inline-style fallback (clean production code). I can patch that quickly.
Commit & push the final cleaned changes for you.
